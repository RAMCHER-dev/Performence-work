#How the algorithm works
Based on the entered data using a formula, it calculates the productivity of the work performed.

#How to use it
Since I present my algorithm as open code, it can be easily imported as a project into Eclipse and IDEA.
Just import the Production folder as a project.
Then run the algorithm starting from the Main.java file.
1.After which you will see what you need to enter, first you need to enter the number of machines or workers participating in the project.
2.Second you need to enter the time in hours for further calculation.
3.And that's all you see your productivity as a percentage.
